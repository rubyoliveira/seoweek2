# SEO Week 2 Project
### Problem Statement
  - A lot of students feel stuck when trying to get help on assignments. There’s so much information online that it’s hard to tell what’s actually helpful. According to the Education Data Initiative, more than 60% of students spend over 3 hours a week just looking for academic help. That’s time they could be learning, but instead they’re lost in a sea of videos, forums, and outdated resources.

### Our Solution
  - We built a simple command-line tool to make that search process smarter and faster. Using Gemini AI, we help students turn confusing questions into better search prompts. Then, we use the YouTube API to find videos that actually explain the topic well. Everything gets saved in a SQLite database, so if a student wants to revisit a video later, it’s all there.
